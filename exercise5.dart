//Take two lists, for example:

// a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
//b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
//and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between them (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

void main() {


List<int> a =  [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89];
List<int> b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13];
Set<int>c ={};

for(var i in a){
for (var j in b){
if(i==j){
c.add(i);
